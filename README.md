# ItsFiveOClockSomewhere
Where is it five o'clock? I need to justify this beer.

## What?
This script will tell you where in the world it's 5:00-5.59pm. The website will also do that for you, if that's you're thing. 

## Why?
I like beer and have often used the phrase "It's five o'clock somewhere" in order to justify myself a fresh Oprah Tinfrey. Then I thought I should probably build something that tells me exactly where it's five o'clock, so I can have instantaneous alcoholic validation.

## How?
1. Clone/download project.
2. Run **npm install** from the root.
3. Fire off script with **node script/request.js** and get those taps pouring!

## When?
I dunno. Anytime. Whenever you're thirsty. 

## Where?
Wherever it's legal (wink).

## Who?
With your mates. Or yourself.

## That web address is a bit long, isn't it?
I'm compensating for something.

## You're not this talented. Who helped you?
[TimeZoneDB](https://timezonedb.com/). They're good people.

## You're an idiot.
Can't hear you. [Throw shrapnel at me here](https://buymeacoff.ee/LoveTheQ) if you really want that remark to sink in.

# Enjoy your Denzel Frothingtons.
